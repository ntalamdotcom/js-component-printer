# js-component-printer
Just a simple JS script to print html element, without printing everything else

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

I need it to print an specific html component for a react app.
However the rendering was a PITA.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

It depends on you webbrowser capabilities. By default, just save as pdf

### Installing

* copy the JS referenced in the html script
* You MUST put this script referenced in the body. The reason for that is that it will hang the rendering if it is in the head. The head is referenced in the function so... self referenced while copying, will be a problem.

### Executing program

* It is just a common web page. paste the code and open a webbrowser to load your html file.
